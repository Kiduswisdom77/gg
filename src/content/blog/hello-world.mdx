Welcome to my new portfolio website and blog! I'm excited to share my thoughts, projects, and experiences with you.

## Why I Built This Site

I've been wanting to create a personal website for a while now to:

1. Showcase my projects and skills
2. Share what I'm learning through blog posts
3. Have a central hub for my professional presence online

## Technology Stack

This site is built with:

- **Next.js 14** - React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript** - For type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** - For styling
- **MDX** - For blog content

## What's Next

I plan to write about:

- Web development best practices
- Machine learning projects
- Open source contributions
- Career growth in tech

Stay tuned for more content!
